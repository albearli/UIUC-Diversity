## Data

This folder contains a Python Script to parse the raw data after downloading from the [source](http://dmi.illinois.edu/) (downloaded files in `./rawData` subdirectory). 

The `./cleanData` subdirectory has better formatted CSVs from the Excel files. The `./json` subdirectory contains the final data used in the frontend.
