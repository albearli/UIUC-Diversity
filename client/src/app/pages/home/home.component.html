              The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has one of the most diverse collegiate student bodies in the world. However,
              while some majors have a wide array of demographics, other programs are more concentrated in racial disparities. This tool aims to provide information
              on the raw data, context for historical norms and racial norms, and progression of diversity within fields. We seek to 
              encourage discussion on racial inequality in higher education and in the professional workplace setting.
              Below, we have overall statistics of every college from publically available data (see About for more information).
